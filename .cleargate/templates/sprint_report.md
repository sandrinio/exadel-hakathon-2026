# SPRINT-<NN> Report: <Sprint Title>

**Status:** Shipped | Partial | Blocked
**Window:** YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD (N calendar days)
**Stories:** N planned / M shipped / K carried over

## §1 What Was Delivered

### User-Facing Capabilities
<!-- One bullet per user-visible outcome, grouped by business goal. Do NOT list stories here. -->
- <capability>

### Internal / Framework Improvements
<!-- Infrastructure, tooling, or agent-contract changes not visible to end users. -->
- <improvement>

### Carried Over
<!-- Stories that did not reach Done/Escalated/Parking Lot. If none, state "None." -->
- None

## §2 Story Results + CR Change Log

<!-- One block per story. For bounces, list each round-trip as a CR event with the exact token.
     CR event types: CR:bug | CR:spec-clarification | CR:scope-change | CR:approach-change
     UR event types: UR:review-feedback | UR:bug
     Each CR:bug and UR:bug counts toward Bug-Fix Tax (§3). CR:scope-change increments arch_bounces. -->

### STORY-NNN-NN: <Title>
- **Status:** Done | Escalated | Parking Lot | Carried Over
- **Complexity:** L<n>
- **Commit:** `<sha>`
- **Bounce count:** qa=N arch=N total=N
- **CR Change Log:**
  | # | Event type | Description | Counter delta |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 1 | CR:bug | <description> | qa_bounces +1 |
- **UR Events:**
  | # | Event type | Feedback | Tax impact |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 1 | UR:review-feedback | <feedback> | none (enhancement) |

## §3 Execution Metrics

<!-- Tallies use the locked event-type vocabulary:
     Bug-Fix Tax = (CR:bug count + UR:bug count) / total story count × 100
     Enhancement Tax = UR:review-feedback count / total story count × 100
     First-pass success rate = stories with qa_bounces=0 AND arch_bounces=0 / total stories × 100
     Token divergence: compare ledger-primary vs task-notification-tertiary; flag if delta >20% -->

## §4 Lessons

<!-- Flashcards added during this sprint window, grouped by tag.
     Preserve the stale-detection pass from reporter.md §5b — stale-candidate symbols
     from each card are surfaced here for human approval. Do NOT modify FLASHCARD.md. -->

### New Flashcards (Sprint Window)

| Date | Tags | Lesson |
|---|---|---|
| YYYY-MM-DD | #tag | <lesson> |

### Flashcard Audit (Stale Candidates)
<!-- For each active card with no [S]/[R] marker, symbols extracted and grepped.
     Candidates below have ALL extracted symbols absent from the current repo. -->

| Card (date · lead-tag · lesson head) | Missing symbols | Proposed marker |
|---|---|---|

If zero candidates: No stale flashcards detected.

### Supersede Candidates
<!-- Newer cards whose lesson directly contradicts an older card's advice. -->

| Newer card | Older card | Proposed marker for older |
|---|---|---|

## §5 Framework Self-Assessment

<!-- Rate each dimension: Green (working well) / Yellow (friction) / Red (blocking).
     "Tooling" subsection MUST include token-divergence finding if §3 divergence flag = YES. -->

### Templates
| Item | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Story template completeness | Green/Yellow/Red | |
| Sprint Plan Template usability | Green/Yellow/Red | |
| Sprint Report template (this one) | Green/Yellow/Red | |

### Handoffs

### Process
| Item | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|

### Lane Audit
<!-- Filled by Reporter at sprint close. One row per fast-lane story. -->

| Story | Files touched | LOC | Demoted? | In retrospect, was fast correct? (y/n) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `STORY-NNN-NN` | N | N | y / n | y / n | |

### Hotfix Audit
<!-- Filled by Reporter at sprint close. One row per hotfix merged during the sprint window. -->

| Hotfix ID | Originating signal | Files touched | LOC | Resolved-by SHA | Could this have been a sprint story? (y/n) | If y — why was it missed at planning? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `HOTFIX-NN` | <signal> | N | N | `<sha>` | y / n | |

### Hotfix Trend
<!-- Filled by Reporter at sprint close. -->

<!-- TBD: Reporter fills at sprint close -->

<Reporter writes a one-paragraph narrative summarising the rolling 4-sprint hotfix count
and a monotonic-increase flag (yes/no). Empty by default — leave the placeholder text
intact for sprints with no hotfixes.>

### Tooling
| Item | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| run_script.sh diagnostic coverage | Green/Yellow/Red | |
| Token ledger completeness | Green/Yellow/Red | |
